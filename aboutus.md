# ABOUT US

##What are Cyber-Physical Systems or CPS?

* Is a CPS any engineered system with a microprocessor?
* Do all CPS need to be connected to the internet?
* Are there a set of basic functions and architectural elements common to all CPS?


The Cyber-Physical Systems Public Working Group (CPS PWG) will bring together experts to help define and shape key aspects of CPS to accelerate its development and implementation within multiple sectors of our economy.

Cyber-Physical Systems or “smart” systems are co-engineered interacting networks of physical and computational components. These systems are at the heart of our critical infrastructure and form the basis of our future smart services. These promise increased efficiency and interaction between computer networks and the physical world enabling advances that improve the quality of life, including advances such as in personalized health care, emergency response, traffic flow management, and the electric power generation and delivery. Key stakeholders in CPS have identified the need to develop a consensus vocabulary and reference architecture to facilitate interoperability between elements and systems, and promote communication across the breadth of CPS stakeholders. As these concepts are developed, it is critical to ensure that timing, dependability, data interoperability and security are considered as first order design principles. NIST is establishing the CPS PWG to address these challenges.

##Subgroups and Meetings

The CPS PWG is composed of five subgroups:

* [Vocabulary and Reference Architecture](../refarch)
* [Use Cases](../usecase)
* [Timing and Synchronization](../timing)
* [Cybersecurity and Privacy](../trustworthiness)
* [Data Interoperability](../data)
